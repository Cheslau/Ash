# Ashteroids
Asteroids Game using Ash Framework

## What's this?
This is my personal experiment extending the Asteroids game example from Richard Lord's [Ash Framework](http://github.com/richardlord/Ash).

The Asteroids example is extended to support 3 rendering modes in one game:

* Flash's Display List (original)
* Starling framework
* Away3D

User will be able to select rendering mode before the game starts.

[TODO attach screen shots]
