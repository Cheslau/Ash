# Ashteroids
Asteroids Game using Ash Framework

## What's this?
This is my personal experiment extending the Asteroids game example from Richard Lord's [Ash Framework](http://github.com/richardlord/Ash).

The Asteroids example is extended to support 3 rendering modes in one game:

* Flash Display List

![Flash Display List](http://abiyasa.com/lab/away3d/ashteroids/mode_native.png "Flash Display List")
* Starling framework

![Starling mode](http://abiyasa.com/lab/away3d/ashteroids/mode_starling.png "Starling framework")
* Away3D 4

![Away3D 4 mode](http://abiyasa.com/lab/away3d/ashteroids/mode_away3d.png "Away3D 4")

User will be able to select rendering mode before the game starts.
