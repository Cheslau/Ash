# Ashteroids
Asteroids Game using Ash Framework

## What's this?
This is my personal experiment project extending the Asteroids game example which originally comes with the Richard Lord's Ash Framework.

The Asteroids example will be extended so the game will have 3 rendering modes in one game:
* Flash's Display List (original)
* Starling framework
* Away3D

User will be able to select rendering mode before the game starts.

[TODO attach screen shot]

This example is also to show how easy it is using Ash framework to switch between renderers. In fact, the game logic and other components stay the same; the only difference is which renderer system is being used.

[TODO attach code]

Currently, the user can only select rendering mode before the game starts. It is not possible to change the game rendering mode in the middle of the game; I just don't have time to do it ;-)
